# StakenZ - Private Liquidity Staking on Solana

StakenZ is a groundbreaking application that enables users to liquidity stake privately on the Solana blockchain. By harnessing the power of Elusiv and Marinade Protocol, StakenZ brings together cutting-edge privacy technology and efficient staking solutions.

## About StakenZ

StakenZ leverages the innovative Elusiv protocol, a blockchain-based, zero-knowledge privacy solution that empowers users and applications with universal encryption capabilities. Elusiv employs zk-SNARKs technology to facilitate private transactions and decentralized compliance solutions, striking a harmonious balance between privacy and compliance.

Additionally, StakenZ integrates with the Marinade Protocol, a Solana-based staking protocol. This integration enables users to liquidity stake SOL tokens and seamlessly initiate instant unstaking operations.

## Features

- **Private Balance Management:** StakenZ enables users to top up their private balance and withdraw funds using the Elusiv protocol.
- **Effortless Liquidity Staking:** With Marinade Protocol, users can liquidity stake SOL tokens and easily initiate unstaking operations.
- **Upcoming GUI Enhancements:** While the current front-end may not be fully polished, rest assured that StakenZ has plans to provide a more intuitive and informative graphical user interface (GUI) in the near future.
- **Future-Focused:** StakenZ is currently available on the Devnet network, but excitingly, it will soon launch on the Solana mainnet, expanding its reach and capabilities.
